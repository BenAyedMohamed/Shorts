1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,495
Let’s

2
00:00:00,495 --> 00:00:00,990
say…

3
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:01,485
technology

4
00:00:01,485 --> 00:00:01,981
never

5
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:02,476
existed.

6
00:00:02,476 --> 00:00:02,971
No

7
00:00:02,971 --> 00:00:03,467
electricity.

8
00:00:03,467 --> 00:00:03,962
No

9
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:04,457
medicine.

10
00:00:04,457 --> 00:00:04,953
No

11
00:00:04,953 --> 00:00:05,448
machines

12
00:00:05,448 --> 00:00:05,943
to

13
00:00:05,943 --> 00:00:06,439
build

14
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:06,934
our

15
00:00:06,934 --> 00:00:07,429
world.

16
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:07,925
Humanity

17
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:08,420
would

18
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:08,915
remain

19
00:00:08,915 --> 00:00:09,411
trapped

20
00:00:09,411 --> 00:00:09,906
in

21
00:00:09,906 --> 00:00:10,401
the

22
00:00:10,401 --> 00:00:10,897
shadows

23
00:00:10,897 --> 00:00:11,392
of

24
00:00:11,392 --> 00:00:11,887
survival.

25
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:12,383
Life

26
00:00:12,383 --> 00:00:12,878
expectancy?

27
00:00:12,878 --> 00:00:13,373
Barely

28
00:00:13,373 --> 00:00:13,869
30

29
00:00:13,869 --> 00:00:14,364
years.

30
00:00:14,364 --> 00:00:14,859
Most

31
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:15,355
children

32
00:00:15,355 --> 00:00:15,850
would

33
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:16,345
never

34
00:00:16,345 --> 00:00:16,841
see

35
00:00:16,841 --> 00:00:17,336
adulthood.

36
00:00:17,336 --> 00:00:17,831
Our

37
00:00:17,831 --> 00:00:18,327
numbers

38
00:00:18,327 --> 00:00:18,822
would

39
00:00:18,822 --> 00:00:19,317
not

40
00:00:19,317 --> 00:00:19,813
reach

41
00:00:19,813 --> 00:00:20,308
billions…

42
00:00:20,308 --> 00:00:20,803
but

43
00:00:20,803 --> 00:00:21,299
remain

44
00:00:21,299 --> 00:00:21,794
only

45
00:00:21,794 --> 00:00:22,289
in

46
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:22,785
the

47
00:00:22,785 --> 00:00:23,280
millions.

48
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:23,775
Cities

49
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:24,271
would

50
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:24,766
never

51
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:25,261
rise,

52
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:25,757
nations

53
00:00:25,757 --> 00:00:26,252
would

54
00:00:26,252 --> 00:00:26,747
never

55
00:00:26,747 --> 00:00:27,242
connect,

56
00:00:27,242 --> 00:00:27,738
and

57
00:00:27,738 --> 00:00:28,233
ideas

58
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:28,728
would

59
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:29,224
move

60
00:00:29,224 --> 00:00:29,719
only

61
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:30,214
as

62
00:00:30,214 --> 00:00:30,710
fast

63
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:31,205
as

64
00:00:31,205 --> 00:00:31,700
a

65
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,196
messenger

66
00:00:32,196 --> 00:00:32,691
on

67
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:33,186
horseback.

68
00:00:33,186 --> 00:00:33,682
There

69
00:00:33,682 --> 00:00:34,177
would

70
00:00:34,177 --> 00:00:34,672
be

71
00:00:34,672 --> 00:00:35,168
no

72
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:35,663
cures

73
00:00:35,663 --> 00:00:36,158
for

74
00:00:36,158 --> 00:00:36,654
disease,

75
00:00:36,654 --> 00:00:37,149
no

76
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:37,644
global

77
00:00:37,644 --> 00:00:38,140
communication,

78
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:38,635
no

79
00:00:38,635 --> 00:00:39,130
exploration

80
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:39,626
of

81
00:00:39,626 --> 00:00:40,121
the

82
00:00:40,121 --> 00:00:40,616
skies

83
00:00:40,616 --> 00:00:41,112
or

84
00:00:41,112 --> 00:00:41,607
the

85
00:00:41,607 --> 00:00:42,102
stars.

86
00:00:42,102 --> 00:00:42,598
Without

87
00:00:42,598 --> 00:00:43,093
technology,

88
00:00:43,093 --> 00:00:43,588
humanity

89
00:00:43,588 --> 00:00:44,084
would

90
00:00:44,084 --> 00:00:44,579
be

91
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:45,074
fragile…

92
00:00:45,074 --> 00:00:45,570
isolated…

93
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,065
and

94
00:00:46,065 --> 00:00:46,560
nearly

95
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,056
powerless

96
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:47,551
against

97
00:00:47,551 --> 00:00:48,046
nature.

98
00:00:48,046 --> 00:00:48,542
The

99
00:00:48,542 --> 00:00:49,037
modern

100
00:00:49,037 --> 00:00:49,532
world

101
00:00:49,532 --> 00:00:50,028
as

102
00:00:50,028 --> 00:00:50,523
we

103
00:00:50,523 --> 00:00:51,018
know

104
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:51,514
it

105
00:00:51,514 --> 00:00:52,009
would

106
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:52,504
not

107
00:00:52,504 --> 00:00:53,000
exist.
